## API and Data Sample

I will use airtable for users to add data to. Once the user uploads their name, Productive.ly will make an API call to display their name.

## SWOT Analysis

Link to a visual: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QWMa7QawqCwcmTji5AyeoCRuymG57psh/view?usp=sharing

### Strengths:

- HTML
- CSS
- Making API Calls
- Basic class component structure

### Weaknesses:

- Difficulty in recognizing aspects of JSX structure
- Getting stuck in my own head
- Making a ternary button
- Sending, then receiving and API call back to back (never done this before)

### Opportunities:

- Get better at class components
- Learn useEffect/State at an operational level
- Leverage classmatesâ€™ wisdom
- Leverage outside sources
- Create an app I would want to use

### Threats:

- Not reaching out for help soon enough! (NO TOKENS!)
