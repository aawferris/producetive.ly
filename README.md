Productive.ly

## Project Description

At Ferrous-Clad, we strive to help our customers experience their carpe diem. Our newest innovation, Productive.ly, will help the focused become more focused, the driven to become more driven and the productive to reach the upper echelons of their potential. Productive.ly is a productivity app with robust features which include a focus timer, a quick task list, a note storage and a built-in break button to help ease your tension throughout your busy day. Are you ready to carpe diem?

I built this app using React.js and use AirTable to create and use my own APIs.  In future iterations I want to make the following changes:
- Transition the code over to become a Chrome Browser Extension
- Create a login so that users see only their notes and tasks
- Remove the input field for inputting name once the name has been entered once. 
- Use local storage to hold user data
- Add a small weather widget in the upper right-hand corner
